While working on Homework03, I took some time to put the function together mutate (dna,motif). I tested my first function and tested it using the 5 testing examples and the other one that didn’t work was the last example where the motif could be any non-empty string, so I had to go back and make adjustments to my functions in order for it to work. Overall, the assignment wasn’t too challenging.
