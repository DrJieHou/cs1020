Everything went smooth during this homework project. However, the one scenario that was particularly tricky for me was the last case provided: the motif is just one nucleotide long. This was really hard to implement because the reverse complement must come after the motif in the sequence. Thus, there must be other conditions defined under the function mutate. However, other than the last case, I was able to implement the mutate function with the help of the in-class discussion for this project.
