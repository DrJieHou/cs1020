In this homework assignment the only part I struggled with was extracting the regions between the motif and it’s reverse complement in the DNA sequence. I also had a little bit of a problem making sure the function stopped running if a requirement was not met but I was able to figure it out. Overall I think that I am getting better at writing the code to accomplish the required tasks.
