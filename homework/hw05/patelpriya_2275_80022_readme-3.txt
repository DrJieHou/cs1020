While working on Homework05, I faced some difficulty at first with getting the answers. I kept receiving a “math domain error” due to a negative number inside of the log function. I had to work around with my codes and was finally able to come up with a code that would give me the answers to my function. Overall, it took some time to figure out the codes, but it was not too difficult.
