For this homework, the work was easy since Dr. Jie Hou has provided me with the necessary information to complete
it. Also, since I was able to meet with him during class, so I was able to discuss with him the error that I had.

First, for the Jukes-Cantor distance, it was quick. Since the only thing to do was to count the differences between the two sequences, 
I was able to do that by comparing the individual letter of the sequences using the for loop. After that, I
divided the difference to make it into a fraction to apply to the final calculation for the Jukes-Cantor distance. 
I got the result the same as Dr. Jie Hou's

Next, the Kimura 2 Parameter Distance, the work was a little bit more difficult. I was trying to figure out a code that 
applied the given list of transversion and transition. I decided to store all the differences into a list and then I used 
each pair of the differences to compare the pair in the two given list. I forgot that I was supposed to turn them 
into a fraction, but thanks to Dr. Jie Hou, I was able to fix that. Finally, I got the same result as Dr.Jie Hou's
