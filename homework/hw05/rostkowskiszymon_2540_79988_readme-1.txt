The first part of the lab was fairly simply. I had no trouble
understanding ORF's and finding complmentary strads. 
I did however have trouble figuring out the code that was in part 2 of the lab.
I had trouble figuring out how to compare the keys and values in the dictionaries 
to get the code to work.
