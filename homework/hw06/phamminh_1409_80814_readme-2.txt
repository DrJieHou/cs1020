For homework6, the work was suprisingly more challanging, and I was very excited when I was able to solve the problem for each of them.
Initially, I tried to break down the function of the "clustering_main" like how Dr. Jie Hou showed me. The only variable that I think that
was difficult to understand was the "clusters". I think the reason why it was difficult to understand them because I was not able to fully 
visualize how function works. After breaking the main function down, I was able to craft the basic the fuctions that was necessary 
for the "clustering_main" to work

The one that I have trouble the most was the "find_nearest_active" because it works along with the "remove" function from the 
activeClusters and I was not able to grasp how to fix the problem. I was able to understnad somewhat what was wrong with my
functions since I used the "break" function that led me to narrow down the possible combinations. Instead, Dr. Jie Hou guided 
me to construct the condition x>y, so it narrow down the area that the location of comparision. 

I think it made more sense now that the [x] and [y] were able to allowed me to work as a specific cordinates compared to that of 
the row[x] and then the location [y] based on the column y, which was more random than usual. 

I was able to meet with Dr. Jie Hou to help me with the other functions of the "linkages" as well. Instead of using row [x] 
then column [y], I was able to use dist[x][y] to allow more of a specific interactions. 

In the end, all the functions work, so I was very worthed to work on this homework! :)
