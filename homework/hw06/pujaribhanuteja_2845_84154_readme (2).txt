Most of the codes for the project were given by the instructor. However, the different versions of the clustering algorithms were to be finished by the students. At first, I was really confused by the single, complete, and UPGMA linkages. However, upon practicing these linkages using the matrices and examples provided on the lecture slides, I was able to understand how these linkages work. Upon practicing these examples, I was able to complete the codes for these individual linkages. Other than the linkage definitions, everything else went smoothly.
